			 	<p>Middlesex Fells Reservation, is Massachusetts state park located in Malden, Medford, Melrose, Stoneham, 
			 	and Winchester.</p> 
			 	<p>This hike is really long and not easy. You could spend a full day hiking across woods, 
			 	boulder and ponds. Indeed, do not mistake the Skyline Trail for a quick afternoon walk. At about 7 
			 	miles in length, it is a real hike that can take most of a day if you like to stop frequently. 
			 	In addition to being long, it is also a difficult hike, with several ascents and descents likely to wear 
			 	you out if you are not in shape. There are points when you have to have real courage to walk and hike.</p>
			 	<p>As you start your walk from parking lot it will lead you to the main trail, leaving Bellevue Pond on your left.
			 	This will lead you to Pine Hill point, there is an Observation tower offers spectacular views of Boston.
			 	By reaching this point you can be tried.</p>
